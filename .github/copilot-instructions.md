# Copilot Code Review Instructions

## Check commit messages for the following rules:

For every pull request, ensure that each commit subject line:
- is no longer than 50 characters,
- starts with a capital letter,
- does not end with a period.

If any subject line violates these rules, leave a comment on the specific commit describing the violations.
Ignore these checks for pull requests created by dependabot[bot].
